# Hammer & Nail Game
The goal of the game is to hit the nail with the hammer by tapping the space bar, a hit is determined when the hitboxes collide. Points are added for every successful hit. There are two different sounds for hits and misses. The hammer is stationary, the nail moves left then right in a loop
